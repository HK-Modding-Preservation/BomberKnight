# Bomber Knight
A Hollow Knight Mod which adds bombs.

Adds a "spell" to the game, which drops a bomb that explodes after 3 seconds dealing damage and breaking damaged floors (like dive does).
This does consume a bomb from your counter which is limited to 5, 10, 15 (based on the bomb bag upgrade). 

## Control
- Casting a bomb requires you to press left and (quick)cast. You can change which cast button should be used in the settings.
- Casting a power bomb requires you to press right instead.

## Bomb Types
There are 5 different types of bombs that you can acquire:
- Grass bombs: Deals 30 damage, no special effect.
- Spore bombs: Deals 20 damage. Leaves a huge cloud upon destruction that persists for 4 seconds.
- Gold bombs: Drop up to 200 geo upon destruction.
- Echo bombs: Deals 25 damage, explodes again 3 and 6 seconds later.
- Power bombs: Consume 3 bombs and 1 lifeblood mask. Deals 60 damage per tick. Powerful enough to break ALL damaged walls/floors, even one sided ones in the CURRENT ROOM. (Can be used anytime in place of another bomb, does not appear in the bomb bag.)

## Settings
- Cast spell on: Defines when the spell should be casted. If set to "quick cast", the spell can only be casted when pressing left and quick cast. Picking "cast" allows you to still cast fireball when pressing left with quick cast, allowing fireball skips. "Both" does what you expect. 
- Pyromaniac: If active, bombs do not hurt you.
